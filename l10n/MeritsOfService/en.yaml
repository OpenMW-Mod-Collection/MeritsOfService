  Getting rewards retroactively:

  3. Run "I.MeritsOfService.RetroactiveUpdate()"
  4. Run "exit()"
  5. Done!

  Note for TR/PT enjoyers!

  Current defaults are intended for factions in just one region (vanilla faction questlines average ~30 quests).
  If you plan to play both Vvardenfell and Mainland guild questlines, I'd strongly suggest adjusting these values for obvious reasons.

  If enabled, skill rewards will trigger all respective handlers (vanilla and modded). This includes contributing to character level and triggering similar things added by other mods.

  If disabled, skill rewards will just raise your base skill level, ignoring all logic which might usually trigger on skill level ups.
